# Seguran√ßa de Redes e Sistemas de Computadores - Project 2

## FServer

Create a File Server service.

- Has the capacity to store the different files (int final version it communicates with a cloud service)
- Authorizes
- Controls the different accesses
- Has a secure communication channel

Uses microservices for its execution, having four modules:
- Main dispatcher with a RESTful API to dispatch the requests to the different components
- One component for the remaining modules

### Usage
Follow these steps to compile, launch the client and the servers
- Run "mvn clean compile assembly:single docker:build" to build a single assembly and a docker image with the .jar file
- Run "docker run -it --rm --entrypoint bash srsc5817258360" to run the image created on a docker environment
- Run "java -cp proj2-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.srsc5817258360.proj2.FClientShell" to run the client shell program
